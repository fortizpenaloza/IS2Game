## Protection

This card is played over an active permanent card, and prevents once the use of
_Cancellation_ over the underlying card.
The effect is cumulative, so 3 _Protection_ over a card prevents _Cancellation_
thrice.

## Reversal

This card is played over a tile, and inverts the tile effect.
  - Over _Moonwalk_ everybody advances N tiles instead of going back N.
  - Over _Speed Up_ go back 4 tiles instead of advancing 4.
  - Over _Wormhole_ advance 4 tiles instead of going back 4.
  - Over a _Card Giving_ tile it has the same effect as _Undo_.
  - Does not have effect over _Atomic Bomb_ (no sense making everyone win) or
  _Time Machine_ (not possible to predict future moves) nor _Empty_.

It's possible to play _Reversal_ over _Reversal_ regaining the original effect.

## Speed Boost

This card is played over a tile, and adds the same effect as _Speed Up_ to that
tile, besides of the current tile effect. the effect is cumulative.
2 times over a _Moonwalk_ tile for example, will  make everybody else go back N
and the player advance 8 tiles.

## Mirror

This card is played over a tile, and inverts the target of that tile.
- Over _Moonwalk_ only the current player goes back N instead of everybody else.
- Over _Wormhole_, _Speed Up_ and _Moonwalk_ everybody else is affected instead
of the player.
- Over a _Card Giving_ tile, everybody else takes one card.
- No effect over _Empty_ tile.
- Nullifies the effect of _Atomic Bomb_ because it will target nobody instead of
everyone.

It's possible to play _Mirror_ over _Mirror_ regaining the original target.
