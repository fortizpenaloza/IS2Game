# Movement (1st iteration)

The game consists on a board, and a set of dice. At least one player is required
for the game to be played.

The players play in round-robin order, rolling the dice to determine the amount
of tiles to advance.

The game is won by the first player to complete a number of laps around the
board. The number of laps determined at the beginning in the game.

## Considerations

- A die has at lest 4 sides, the dice used in game do not need to have the same
amount of sides.
- The board consists of a number of tiles and is circular, so the first tile is
after the last tile.
