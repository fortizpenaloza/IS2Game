# Software Engineering II - Board Game

Exercise of modeling a board game for teaching purpouses.

The game simulates a board game, with multiple players over a circular path of tiles, won by the first player to complete a number of laps around the board.
- Movement is determinated by dice rolls
- Some tiles may have effects over the player/players
- Some tiles will make the player draw cards, which also have effects over the player/players

The development is meant to be done in 4 iterations
- [First iteration](docs/1-movement.md): movement on the board, turns, winning.
- [Second iteration](docs/2-tiles.md): tiles with effects
- [Third iteration](docs/3-cards-basic.md): basic cards
- [Fourth iteration](docs/4-cards-complex.md): complex cards
- [Extra](docs/5-extra.md): ideas for aditional cards/tiles
